# A new markdown file

**Open Source Software Engineering**

This course has helped me revisit the very purpose of *GitHub*. GitHub allows professionals to track changes to code, collaborate, and share. I also refreshed my understanding of 
repositories, cloning, committing/pushing, pull requests, etc. I thought it was also cool to experiment with [markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
I also added a [profile readme](https://github.com/areskeldi)
